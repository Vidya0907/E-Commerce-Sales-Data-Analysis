# üõçÔ∏è E-Commerce Sales Data Analysis Dashboard

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes key performance metrics in an e-commerce business, including sales, customer behavior, product performance, and profitability. The dashboard helps stakeholders identify trends, optimize operations, and make data-driven decisions.

<br/>

## üìä Dashboard Overview

The dashboard is divided into two main pages, each designed to analyze different business dimensions and customer insights.



### 1. **Sales Performance Overview**
- **Total Revenue, Quantity Sold, Profit, and AOV**
- **Sales Revenue by State**
- **Order Quantity by Payment Mode**

- **Sales Conversion Efficiency by Product Sub-Category**
- **Profit Contribution by Product Sub-Category**

**üìñ Storyline:**  
This page provides a snapshot of overall business performance, helping assess which states and products are driving revenue and profit. It also evaluates how different payment modes influence order quantity and highlights the **most efficient sub-categories** in converting potential into actual sales. Seasonal trends in monthly profits are visualized to uncover high and low-performing periods.



### 2. **Customer and Product Insights**
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) by Customer**
- **Top Customers by Purchase Amount**
- **Product Category Distribution by Quantity**
- **Moving Average Profit and Monthly Profit Comparison**

**üìñ Storyline:**  
This section dives into customer-level analytics to identify **top revenue-generating customers** and product preferences. CLTV helps in understanding the most valuable long-term customers.

## üßÆ DAX Measures Used 





1. CLTV = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM(Details[Amount]),
    ALLEXCEPT(Orders, Orders[CustomerName])
)



2. Moving Avg Profit = 
AVERAGEX(
    DATESINPERIOD(
        Orders[Order Date], 
        MAX(Orders[Order Date]), 
        -3, 
        MONTH

    CALCULATE(SUM(Details[Profit]))
)


3. Sales Conversion Efficiency = 
VAR TotalQty = CALCULATE(SUM(Details[Quantity]))

    SWITCH(TRUE(),

        TotalProfit < 0, -1,
        TRUE(), TotalProfit / TotalQty
    )
